# NestJS API Template

<!-- Uncomment the line below when using this template for a project. -->
<!-- This project was built with the [NestJS Template]([github link goes here)](https://github.com/mattburnett-repo/nestjs-api-template). -->

This repo is a scaffolded / boilerplate implementation of NestJS and supporting modules.

The purpose of this repo is to provide a straight-forward way to quickly stand up a RESTful API NestJS app, without having to install / configure the many packages that are useful for an average project.

An instance of this repo is deployed [here](https://nestjs-api-template.fly.dev/api), where it connects to a database hosted at another domain.

This is a work-in-progress.

Starting points for database connectivity, API endpoint generation, entity creation, data seeding, testing, authentication, etc. are available.

Example code is provided in the [src/example](./src/example/) folder.
