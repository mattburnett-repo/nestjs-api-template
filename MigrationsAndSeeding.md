# Migrations / Seeding

- Create a migration
- Generate a migration.
- Run a migration.
- Seed the `example` and `user` tables.

This repo uses v.0.3.x of the typeorm CLI. Because of the way this version of the CLI works, you need to include the full path to the migrations directory after the script name. In the following examples, the migrations directory is `src/db/migrations`.

If you have added `NODE_ENV` vars to your npm scripts, you should add the var name to the end of the `migration:xxx` script name. For example, if you have added `NODE_ENV=local` var to the `migration:generate` script, you should rename the script to `migration:generate:local`.

Create a migration

```bash
yarn migration:create src/db/migrations/name.of.migration
```

Generate a migration

```bash
yarn migration:generate src/db/migrations/name.of.migration
```

Run a migration

```bash
yarn migration:run
```

Seed the `example` and `user` tables

```bash
yarn type-ext:db:seed
```
