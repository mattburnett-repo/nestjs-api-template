# How to use

If there are questions about NestJS, the [Overview](https://docs.nestjs.com/) section of the docs is a good place to start.

If you just want to jump in and see what happens, you can [create new endpoint with nest g resource <resource.name.goes.here>](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/crud-generator#generating-a-new-resource), and follow the `example` code provided in this repo.

Here is a general guide for getting started. Look at existing app / auth / example / user code for further guidance.

- nest g resource _name-of-project_
- Fill out as needed, referring to app / auth / example / user code when necessary
  - Use class-validator (ie. @IsUUID, @IsNotEmpty, etc.) decorators as much as possible.
  - entity
    - create an entities folder
      - create entity file (xxx.entity.ts)
    - migration:generate / migration:run
  - dto
  - service
  - controller
  - module
  - Revise / run tests
- Keep the docs up to date
  ```bash
  yarn docs:create
  ```
- Keep the README.md file accurate and up to date.
