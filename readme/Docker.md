# Docker

There is a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) in the root of this repo.

A [sample.docker-compose.yaml](./sample.docker-compose.yaml) is provided as well.

- Use this as a template for your own docker-compose.yaml file.

### Keep in mind that Dockerfile doesn't like single quotes, and docker-compose doesn't like single or double quotes.
