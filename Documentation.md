# Documentation

- This repo uses the `Compodoc` plugin. You can generate the document set with this command

  ```bash
  yarn docs:create
  ```

  and then view it at [localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).

  ***

  By default, Compodoc creates documentation files in a `documentation` folder, mounted on the project root.
